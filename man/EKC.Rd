\title{Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC)}
\usage{
EKC(.data = NULL, n = NULL, nv = NULL, lowest.eig = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a data frame, a numeric matrix, covariance matrix or correlation matrix from which to determine the number of factors.}

\item{n}{the number of cases (subjects, participants, or units) if a covariance matrix is supplied in \code{.data}.}

\item{nv}{the number of variables if the critical values are required.}

\item{lowest.eig}{minimal eigenvalues to retain. Default is Kaiser's suggestion of 1.}

\item{...}{further argument for \code{cor_nest()}.}
}
\value{
The number of factors to retain or the crititical eigenvalues.
}
\description{
Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC)
}
\note{
As Rnest version >= 1.2, a correction to EKC was done which was reported by Marcel van Assen (personnal communication, june 2025), which was found in Rnest and other packages as well. There was a confusion in the sample and critical eigenvalues in equation 2 (Braeken & van Assen, 2017, p. 454).
